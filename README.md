# Mr Robot's Neovim configuration files

- Bonsoir, Elliot.

## TODO

- install fold manager or create own plugin for this
- fix opening windows in split view
- fix color window for lsp tooltip
- nice to display all files with linting errors
- don't show entire file name when searching in fuzzy finder (this way we can see the file name)

## Cheat sheet
- how to swap panes (horizontally or vertically) ctrl + w + x
